## Instruction Materials

### Required

- Campbell, Neil, and Jane Reece. **Biology** 11th ed. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing, Menlo Park, CA
    - You can use the MasteringBiology companion online. There are a lot of resources available for practice problems. [Click here TODO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17yVWFe9zlXYtiq2JqQyJHAt_k1bVz5uFxi8Vl-Hjqe0/edit?usp=sharing) for instructions on setting up an account. The Course ID for this course is: **MBFISHER TODO**.

- Morgan, Judith and Eloise Carter 2011. **Investigating Biology: A Laboratory Manual for BIOLOGY TODO**, 8th ed. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing, Menlo Park, CA

- Access to a computer, printer, and the internet, including D2L course pages (the course and many assignments will largely be administered via D2L). Several computer labs are available for students at all PCC campuses. (eg. library in Bldg 9, Student Learning Center, Bldg 7, and Resources centers, 1st floor Bldg 7).

#### Socrative

- We will take advantage of a student response system called [Socrative](https://b.socrative.com/login/student/). The Room Name is **FISHER2070**. We will be using this tool to assess your (collective and personal) comprehension of topics in real time in the classroom. I'll be designing questions that I'll ask during lecture and lab and posting them to the room on Socrative. You'll be able to answer these questions from any browser or from the [ios or Android app](https://www.socrative.com/apps.html) downloaded onto your phone or tablet. If you can, please bring such a device to class every day. **If you are unable to do this, please let me know as soon as possible**.


### Strongly Recommended

- Jump drive or cloud storage such as Google Drive 
- Calendar or day planner. 
- Many students have found it very useful to keep a set of colored pencils or pens for various uses during lecture and lab class.



### Optional
- *Student Study Guide* (Workbook to go with Campbell). Taylor, M. and/orWebsite access that comes with the new textbook or can be purchased separately.
- Plan to access to other high-quality educational and library resources including those recommended in class and/or posted at D2L.- Goggles and gloves are provided in the lab, but if you prefer to use your own, please bring these.

### Table of Graded Materials

|Graded Component|Description|Total Points|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Exams|Exams will be based upon the guided learning that is expected to take place during the lectures, with support of this learning taking place though a variety of other means, including textbook reading, class activities, homework, laboratory exercises, supplementary reading, and more. There will be 3 regular exams.  Your lowest score of these 3 exams will be dropped.  Because I drop your lowest exam score, no early or make up exams will be given. There are **no exceptions**. Unless otherwise announced, you will have a class period (1hr 50min) to take each exam.  The format of each exam will include a combination of multiple-choice, matching, diagraming and short answer questions. Please take care of restroom needs before the exam. If you arrive late to an exam, you will only have the time remaining to complete the exam. If you arrive to an exam so late that some people have finished, you will not be able to take the exam. If you have a cell phone out during an exam, it will be considered cheating. 2 @ 150 pts. each|300 pts.|
|Final Exam|The final exam will have the same format, with questions that ask you to use, remember, and consider all course material, with about 50% emphasis on the final two weeks of the term.  You must take the final exam to pass the class. **You may not drop your final exam score**.  Makeup exams for the final exam will be given only under very extenuating circumstances and only upon prompt notification of the instructor.  It is likely that a makeup final exam will not be same exam taken by the rest of the class. It may be in long-answer or essay format, to be determined at the discretion of the instructor. It is not to your advantage to take a makeup final exam for trivial reasons, but if you are genuinely too ill to take the exam at the scheduled time, let me know as soon as possible. Keep in mind that grades are due soon after the final exam date, so time will be limited.|200 pts.|
|TODO Biology Study Skills|These assignments are designed to help you learn methods to help you succeed in this class and in future classes.  Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i1d9N6OxcFaSIhcMX2pY9y0dqOKbdLDBZ-U2L0c-PnM/edit?usp=sharing) for more information|TODO pts.|
|In-class assignments, homework, online assignments, participation (IHOP)|In order to promote active learning and to practice applying what you’re learning, there will be homework and in-class assignments throughout the term.  Many of these will be small group discussion-based critical thinking assignments.  You must be in class to participate and receive credit for in-class assignments. In-class assignments cannot be made up. Homework will also be assigned as needed to promote learning. Late homework policies are described in the “TODO late assignment” section.|TODO pts.|
|Lab participation 10 @ 6 pts. each||60 pts.|
|Lab quizzes 9 @ 10 pts. each||90 pts.|
|Scientific Research Project: Literature|TODO|10 pts.|
|Scientific Research Project: Introduction|TODO|10 pts.|
|Scientific Research Project: First Draft|TODO|10 pts.|
|Scientific Research Project: Peer Reviews 2 @ 10 pts. each|TODO|20 pts.|

## Course Policies

### Grading Guidelines
[PCC Grading Guidelines](https://catalog.pcc.edu/handbook/g301-gradingguidelines/)

### Grade template
TODO make google spreadsheet and add link here.

### Late Assignments

TODO

### Extra Credit

There will be no extra credit opportunities. This is biology department-wide policy at PCC.

### Regrade Policy
If you wish to dispute a grade, we will consider your request up to one full week after the assignment has been returned to you and you have access to solutions. Requests for grade adjustments beyond the one-week deadline will not be considered.Re-grade requests for assignments and exams will be handled online. In order for a re-grade to be considered, you must message me the following:1. Which question you want addressed2. What your answer was (exactly!)3. Detailed justification for point recoveryAny requests that do not include ALL THREE things WILL NOT be reviewed. I use this re-grade policy because sometimes writing about the question helps students realize where the mistake was (this is certainly the case for me when I write about things). This means that after-class re-grade ambushes will be met with frowns.

## Additional Logistics

### Course Reminders
**Students must pass BI 211 with a C or above to be admitted into courses for which BI 211 is a prerequisite**.Please be sure to speak with your instructor and an advisor if you are planning to transfer BI 211 credits to another college or university.  In most cases, Principles of Biology courses 211-213 are not equivalent across institutions.  It is generally best to take all three at the same place to avoid missing critical knowledge that you will need in your 300 level coursework.

### Academic Courtesy
Students must demonstrate respect for fellow students during the class period. Please keep in mind that your classmates may have beliefs and opinions that differ from your own. I expect you to show courtesy toward everyone.

Refrain from talking and other distracting behavior.

Please come to class on time. If you do come to class late, please try to be as unobtrusive as possible. If you must leave early, sit near the exit and try to wait for a break to leave. Leaving in the middle of lecture can be very disruptive.

Please feel free to have food and drink in the classroom as long as it is not disruptive; the same is **not** true of lab, of course.

Students are expected to help maintain the appearance of the classroom. Please discard all trash. This is Portland - y'all know the Leave No Trace mantra.

### Academic Integrity
Students are expected to be honest and ethical in their academic work. Cheating, plagiarism, falsifying, and working with others to cheat are all forms of academic dishonesty. This includes submitting work that is identical (or nearly so, based on the judgment of the instructor) to that of another student, even when completed in the context of “group” work. Various penalties may be imposed and a fair hearing process is in place. Refer to Academic Integrity Policy, which is in the Students’ Rights and Responsibilities Handbook, accessible from the PCC home page under Resources.
[Code of Student Conduct](www.pcc.edu/about/policy/student-rights/student-rights.pdf#code-of-student-conduct)

### Sanctuary College
PCC is a sanctuary college.  For more information, see [www.pcc.edu/resources/undocumented-students/](www.pcc.edu/resources/undocumented-students/).

### Dropping/Withdrawing and Grade Options
Pay attention to the college deadlines for withdrawing from the course or electing a P/NP or Audit option. You are responsible for learning what the options are, and exercising them within the designated time period.  A "W" grade will be granted to the student who has followed established school procedures for properly withdrawing from the course within the specified time limits (consult your PCC Schedule of Classes).You may change to Audit or Pass/No Pass up until the dates specified in the schedule of classes.

### Title IX/Non-Discrimination statement
Portland Community College is committed to creating and fostering a learning and working environment based on open communication and mutual respect.  if you believe you have encountered sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual assault, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, age, national origin, veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability please contact the Office of Equity and Inclusion at (971) 722-5840 or equity.inclusion@pcc.edu.

### Incompletes
A student may receive an I for a course if they miss an essential part of the class for a documented reason acceptable to the instructor (Trips out of town for vacation, family reunions, or work are not acceptable reasons). To be eligible for an incomplete, the student must have completed 90% of the course with a grade of C or better.  The I grade is not substitution for substandard performance.  To receive an I, the student and the instructor must sign a written agreement and submit a copy with the division administrative staff.

### Students with Disabilities
 PCC is committed to supporting all students. If you plan to use academic accommodations for this course, you must meet with the instructor privately and in-person to discuss your needs. Accommodations are not retroactive; they can only after you meet with the instructor and the instructor receives the “Approved Academic Accommodations” letter. To request academic accommodations for a disability, please contact a disability services counselor on any PCC campus. Additional information may be located at [www.pcc.edu/resources/disability](www.pcc.edu/resources/disability).
