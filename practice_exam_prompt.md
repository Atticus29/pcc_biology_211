# Crowd-generated Practice Exam TODO

## Prompt

In an effort to give you practice answering mutliple-choice questions related to the material on Exam TODO, but more importantly to give you practice with the arguably more useful cognitive skill of _writing_ good multiple-choice exam questions, you'll be asked to construct a practice exam as a class and then take the practice exam individually as a low-stakes IHOP assignment.

To receive full credit for crowd-generated practice exam TODO, each student is asked to add one **multiple-choice** question **from each chapter** covered in the exam to the google form (TODO you will each be emailed an invitation to edit the form). After everybody has completed this step, each student will be asked to then **take the practice exam individually**.

#### Guidelines for Writing Practice Exam Questions

- [ ] Add your name to the questions that you write (see example question in the google form)
- [ ] **Do not provide the answers to the questions**. I will do that.
- [ ] Students who add questions after other students are required to check existing students' questions to avoid duplicates. **Credit will not be granted to duplicate questions or re-phrased questions**. Note that this means that the earlier you submit your questions, the less work you have to do.
- [ ] If you insert a duplicate question **before** another student's question to create the appearance that you came up with question first, **this will be considered academic dishonesty and you will at minimum receive no credit for the assignment**. Please note that google spreadsheets are versioned, which means that I can track which edits occur and when, so it will be easy to detect such insertions.
- [ ] If you need some help working with Google Forms, please see my [tutorial video for generating questions here](TODO).

#### Guidelines for Taking Practice Exam

- [ ] For full credit, students are required to answer the final feedback question, highlighting questions that are difficult to answer or otherwise might need my attention.

## Instructor checklist

### Before

- [ ] Invite students to edit document by PCC email address

### After

- [ ] Add last question, "Last Question: Were there any questions you felt were unfair or worded in a way that was confusing even though you knew the content of the question well? If none, please write, “none”. Please note that difficult and unfair are not synonymous."
- [ ] Assign credit to students based on prompt criteria listed above
- [ ] Copy final product to another form, format as quiz, and make readable but not writeable. Provide link to students and deadline on D2L.
- [ ] Take the practice exam yourself; identify problematic questions and remove. If egregious enough, deduct points from offending questions.
