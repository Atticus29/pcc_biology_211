### Table of Graded Materials

|Graded Component|Description|Total Points|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Exams|Exams will be based upon the guided learning that is expected to take place during the lectures, with support of this learning taking place though a variety of other means, including textbook reading, class activities, homework, laboratory exercises, supplementary reading, and more. There will be 3 regular exams. Your lowest score of these 3 exams will be dropped. Because I drop your lowest exam score, no early or make up exams will be given. There are **no exceptions**. Unless otherwise announced, you will have a class period (1hr 50min) to take each exam. The format of each exam will include a combination of multiple-choice, matching, diagraming and short answer questions. Please take care of restroom needs before the exam. If you arrive late to an exam, you will only have the time remaining to complete the exam. If you arrive to an exam so late that some people have finished, you will not be able to take the exam. If you have a cell phone out during an exam, it will be considered cheating. 2 @ 150 pts. each|300 pts.|
|Final Exam|The final exam will have the same format, with questions that ask you to use, remember, and consider all course material, with about 50% emphasis on the final two weeks of the term. You must take the final exam to pass the class. **You may not drop your final exam score**. Makeup exams for the final exam will be given only under very extenuating circumstances and only upon prompt notification of the instructor. It is likely that a makeup final exam will not be same exam taken by the rest of the class. It may be in long-answer or essay format, to be determined at the discretion of the instructor. It is not to your advantage to take a makeup final exam for trivial reasons, but if you are genuinely too ill to take the exam at the scheduled time, let me know as soon as possible. Keep in mind that grades are due soon after the final exam date, so time will be limited.|200 pts.|
|TODO Biology Study Skills|These assignments are designed to help you learn methods to help you succeed in this class and in future classes. Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i1d9N6OxcFaSIhcMX2pY9y0dqOKbdLDBZ-U2L0c-PnM/edit?usp=sharing) for more information|TODO pts.|
|In-class assignments, homework, online assignments, participation (IHOP)|In order to promote active learning and to practice applying what you’re learning, there will be homework and in-class assignments throughout the term. Many of these will be small group discussion-based critical thinking assignments. You must be in class to participate and receive credit for in-class assignments. In-class assignments cannot be made up. Homework will also be assigned as needed to promote learning. Late homework policies are described in the “Late Assignments” section.|200 pts.|
|Lab participation 10 @ 6 pts. each|TODO|60 pts.|
|Lab quizzes 9 @ 10 pts. each|See additional details below|90 pts.|
|Scientific Research Project: Literature|TODO|10 pts.|
|Scientific Research Project: Introduction|TODO|10 pts.|
|Scientific Research Project: First Draft|TODO|10 pts.|
|Scientific Research Project: Peer Reviews 2 @ 10 pts. each|TODO|20 pts.|
|Scientific Research Project: final paper|TODO|100 pts.|


### Additional details about graded materials
- Laboratory
    - The laboratory session is the part of class where you learn by direct observation and by asking questions, designing experiments, handling biological and chemical material, and using equipment. Note that this course includes undergraduate research that will encourage students to practice science by doing science. This will include, but not be limited to, researching primary literature, designing experiments, collaborative decision-making, use of instrumentation, peer review, data analysis, and scientific writing.
    - You must come to the lab prepared. Reading, studying, and preparing for activities before you come to class is vital for success in the course, and part of this will involve communication with peers outside of class time. You are expected to perform the lab work cooperatively with your group. LEFT OFF HERE In addition to the written materials, you will also be graded on preparedness, participation, safety compliance, cleanliness, and teamwork with your group.  You will lose points if you are late or leave inappropriately early.  This means you must be fully engaged, work at an appropriate pace, and leave only when your work is done.  Generally, I will ask you some questions, look over written work, and will “sign off” on your work at the end of each lab period as a record of your participation. Sometimes you’ll have written work to submit.  I will announce this at the beginning of a given lab, but you should also check D2Lfor occasional supplemental handouts.

- *Scientific Research project* (a.k.a, “The Amylase Project”)
    - Assignments include researching scientific literature and designing and conducting an experiment in the laboratory. It will culminate with the writing, peer review, and submission of the “Amylase Scientific Paper”. These assignments are discussed in separate handouts and during class time. Look for these on D2L and ask questions as needed to ensure that you understand the requirements.
- *Lab quizzes*
    - Will cover the previous lab activities and will **also include questions that refer to the current lab activities**. The best way to earn quiz points is to make sure that you are able to discuss and explain the lab activity’s goals, background, methods used, and results before you leave each lab session.  Please work cooperatively with your group to answer the lab manual study questions at the end of each unit to ensure you understood everything in that unit. The lab manual answers will not be submitted and graded. Instead, the quiz will be used to assess how much you learned. Also, read and study each lab activity before you do it. Use your textbook as a resource if you need additional information to support your study of the lab concepts. You will have the first 10-15 minutes of lab time to complete the quiz. If you are late, you will only have the time remaining to complete it, and if you are more than ten minutes late, you cannot take the quiz. There will be no make-up lab quizzes except TODO as part of a complete makeup lab attendance as described above.

## Course Policies

### Grading Guidelines
[PCC Grading Guidelines](https://catalog.pcc.edu/handbook/g301-gradingguidelines/)

### Grade template
TODO make google spreadsheet and add link here.

### Late Assignments

All homework assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date; I accept paper or electronic submissions, but have a **strong preference for submissions being turned in on D2L to keep them in the same place** and to streamline the grading. If you turn materials in late on the date due, even if you are just tardy, they will be marked down up to 10%. Late assignments will be marked down 25% each class day after the due date. Late assignments will not be accepted after 1 week past their due date. No late materials will be accepted after the last day of class.

Late assignments will be accepted for full credit under extenuating circumstances, such as when you miss class due to illness. These are considered “excused absences” **if you communicate and explain promptly**.

### Extra Credit

There will be no extra credit opportunities. This is biology department-wide policy at PCC.

### Regrade Policy
If you wish to dispute a grade, we will consider your request up to one full week after the assignment has been returned to you and you have access to solutions. Requests for grade adjustments beyond the one-week deadline will not be considered.Re-grade requests for assignments and exams will be handled online. In order for a re-grade to be considered, you must message me the following:1. Which question you want addressed2. What your answer was (exactly!)3. Detailed justification for point recoveryAny requests that do not include ALL THREE things WILL NOT be reviewed. I use this re-grade policy because sometimes writing about the question helps students realize where the mistake was (this is certainly the case for me when I write about things). This means that after-class re-grade ambushes will be met with frowns.

## Additional Logistics

### Course Reminders
**Students must pass BI 211 with a C or above to be admitted into courses for which BI 211 is a prerequisite**.Please be sure to speak with your instructor and an advisor if you are planning to transfer BI 211 credits to another college or university. In most cases, Principles of Biology courses 211-213 are not equivalent across institutions. It is generally best to take all three at the same place to avoid missing critical knowledge that you will need in your 300 level coursework.

### Academic Courtesy
Students must demonstrate respect for fellow students during the class period. Please keep in mind that your classmates may have beliefs and opinions that differ from your own. I expect you to show courtesy toward everyone.

Refrain from talking and other distracting behavior.

Please come to class on time. If you do come to class late, please try to be as unobtrusive as possible. If you must leave early, sit near the exit and try to wait for a break to leave. Leaving in the middle of lecture can be very disruptive.

Please feel free to have food and drink in the classroom as long as it is not disruptive; the same is **not** true of lab, of course.

Students are expected to help maintain the appearance of the classroom. Please discard all trash. This is Portland - y'all know the Leave No Trace mantra.

### Photography, video, and audio recording
Video and audio recording of lectures or class activities is not allowed except under approved circumstances such as for legally-required learning accommodations.  Photographing, video-, or audio-recording a classmate or instructor without their permission is considered a violation of privacy and is not allowed.  
Photographing biological specimens or lab instrumentation is allowed and encouraged in the context of our learning activities.


### Academic Integrity
Students are expected to be honest and ethical in their academic work. Cheating, plagiarism, falsifying, and working with others to cheat are all forms of academic dishonesty. This includes submitting work that is identical (or nearly so, based on the judgment of the instructor) to that of another student, even when completed in the context of “group” work. Various penalties may be imposed and a fair hearing process is in place. Refer to Academic Integrity Policy, which is in the Students’ Rights and Responsibilities Handbook, accessible from the PCC home page under Resources.
[Code of Student Conduct](www.pcc.edu/about/policy/student-rights/student-rights.pdf#code-of-student-conduct)

### Sanctuary College
PCC is a sanctuary college. For more information, see [www.pcc.edu/resources/undocumented-students/](www.pcc.edu/resources/undocumented-students/).

### Dropping/Withdrawing and Grade Options
Pay attention to the college deadlines for withdrawing from the course or electing a P/NP or Audit option. You are responsible for learning what the options are, and exercising them within the designated time period. A "W" grade will be granted to the student who has followed established school procedures for properly withdrawing from the course within the specified time limits (consult your PCC Schedule of Classes).You may change to Audit or Pass/No Pass up until the dates specified in the schedule of classes.

### Title IX/Non-Discrimination statement
Portland Community College is committed to creating and fostering a learning and working environment based on open communication and mutual respect. If you believe you have encountered sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual assault, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, age, national origin, veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability please contact the Office of Equity and Inclusion at (971) 722-5840 or equity.inclusion@pcc.edu.

### Incompletes
A student may receive an I for a course if they miss an essential part of the class for a documented reason acceptable to the instructor (Trips out of town for vacation, family reunions, or work are not acceptable reasons). To be eligible for an incomplete, the student must have completed 90% of the course with a grade of C or better. The I grade is not substitution for substandard performance. To receive an I, the student and the instructor must sign a written agreement and submit a copy with the division administrative staff.

### Students with Disabilities
 PCC is committed to supporting all students. If you plan to use academic accommodations for this course, you must meet with the instructor privately and in-person to discuss your needs. Accommodations are not retroactive; they can only after you meet with the instructor and the instructor receives the “Approved Academic Accommodations” letter. To request academic accommodations for a disability, please contact a disability services counselor on any PCC campus. Additional information may be located at [www.pcc.edu/resources/disability](www.pcc.edu/resources/disability).

### Tips for success in the course

Ask questions and respect your classmates' rights to ask questions. Asking questions is a hallmark of good science!  Every student should feel comfortable asking questions. Don't give up if you feel you don't know what to ask. Learning how to communicate effectively should be one of your goals in a science class.   Everyone gets "stuck" at one time or another. Effectively asking questions to help settle your confusion is a very useful and achievable skill. It also happens to be a trait of a good scientist!
