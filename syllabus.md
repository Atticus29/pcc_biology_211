## Instruction Materials

### Required

- Campbell, Neil, and Jane Reece. **Biology** 11th ed. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing, Menlo Park, CA
    - You can use the MasteringBiology companion online. There are a lot of resources available for practice problems. [Click here TODO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17yVWFe9zlXYtiq2JqQyJHAt_k1bVz5uFxi8Vl-Hjqe0/edit?usp=sharing) for instructions on setting up an account. The Course ID for this course is: **MBFISHER TODO**.

- Morgan, Judith and Eloise Carter 2011. **Investigating Biology: A Laboratory Manual for BIOLOGY TODO**, 8th ed. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing, Menlo Park, CA

- Access to a computer, printer, and the internet, including D2L course pages (the course and many assignments will largely be administered via D2L). Several computer labs are available for students at all PCC campuses. (eg. library in Bldg 9, Student Learning Center, Bldg 7, and Resources centers, 1st floor Bldg 7).

#### Socrative

- We will take advantage of a student response system called [Socrative](https://b.socrative.com/login/student/). The Room Name is **FISHER2070**. We will be using this tool to assess your (collective and personal) comprehension of topics in real time in the classroom. I'll be designing questions that I'll ask during lecture and lab and posting them to the room on Socrative. You'll be able to answer these questions from any browser or from the [ios or Android app](https://www.socrative.com/apps.html) downloaded onto your phone or tablet. If you can, please bring such a device to class every day. **If you are unable to do this, please let me know as soon as possible**.


### Strongly Recommended

- Jump drive or cloud storage such as Google Drive 
- Calendar or day planner. 
- Many students have found it very useful to keep a set of colored pencils or pens for various uses during lecture and lab class.



### Optional
- *Student Study Guide* (Workbook to go with Campbell). Taylor, M. and/orWebsite access that comes with the new textbook or can be purchased separately.
- Plan to access to other high-quality educational and library resources including those recommended in class and/or posted at D2L.- Goggles and gloves are provided in the lab, but if you prefer to use your own, please bring these.
